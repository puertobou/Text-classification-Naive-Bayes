Over the course of the evening we witnessed all types — from The Classicist (in a Venetian-style eye mask con handle) to The Sex Kitten (a ribbon of fancy black lace tied over the eyes), from The Psycho (a terrifying translucent iteration of the “Eyes Wide Shut” mask) to The Jolly Enthusiast (a woman in a Vegas-style eye mask, a rhapsody in blue feathers).

On July 19, President Bush pointed out that the dollar's high value relative to other currencies had dampened demand for American exports and hurt corporate profits, suggesting the need for corrective action. But on Thursday Paul O'Neill, the secretary of the Treasury, joined his two most recent predecessors in backing the strong-dollar policy that has helped to keep inflation and import prices low, and foreign investment high, during the past decade. Propping up or weakening the dollar would require interventions that might do more harm than good. For the time being, Mr. Bush and Mr. O'Neill should sit back and allow economic trends to influence the currency's position."

https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/art-murmur-update-from-art-basel-miami/,Art Murmur | Update from Art Basel Miami," For the second year in a row, the pool at The Raleigh is proving too inviting to resist. At Jeffrey Deitch’s late-night party, there were so many skinny-dipping galleristas that the scene resembled a Spencer Tunick photo… Turns out the ripped-from-the-Colosseum Roman soldiers clanking around town are not here for a sword-and-sandals convention but to hype a freshman fair, Roma Contemporary, making its debut in February… It seems there’s safety in numbers at this year’s fair. More and more dealers are sharing spaces, forging “Survivor”-like alliances to avoid being voted off next year, when the fought-after spots are reassessed by the new regime. Mary Boone and Rafael Jablonka from Cologne have the smartest set-up: a room each to do with as they will and a third make-nice space for Eric Fischl, the one artist the two galleries share… Massive steroid-charged artwork is not limited to the main fair. It also gets a workout at Pulse, where there is a courtyard stocked with jacked-up sculptures by Jurgen Mayer, Chris Larson and the tattooist-cum-fine artist Duke Reilly. Reilly’s work is a replica of a revolutionary war submarine called the “Turtle,” which in truth looks more like an old whisky barrel. The larkish Reilly submerged his work in the Hudson River early this year and “attacked” the QM2, an offence which got him arrested (the $120,000 tag for the piece includes a video of his capture)… It’s not just the wholesale appropriation trend that is trying the patience of gallerists. As the circuit hits 23 fairs and counting, FedEx and other couriers cannot handle the volume of art that’s zipping round the world. Galleries will soon have to find alternative methods, with many acknowledging that delivery delays have been worse than ever. Some shipments failed to arrive. For the first day, Berlin’s Galerie Michael Schultz had to make do with a minimalist set up of two canvases (the rest of the booth showed up last night); while a Danish gallery canceled completely when they received word that its shipment wouldn’t make it in time. That was good news for on person at least: the booth-less Aussie art collective The Glue Society was promoted into the space to exhibit its waggish light boxes, which show satellite images of what appear to be ancient Biblical scenes.
