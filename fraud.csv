One person involved in the case on the Tiffany side told me at the time that 95 percent of everything on eBay that was supposedly made by Tiffany was, in fact, fraudulent.) I hope they don’t party too hard at eBay not only because Tiffany is sure to appeal but also because it has lost three similar cases in Europe, brought by Rolex, Hermes and Louis Vuitton. No, the real problem here stems from eBay’s attitude toward its customers: namely, the site had no real responsibility toward rectifying wrongs — of any sort — that occur during an eBay transaction.
